📄 App Report – QuickPack List
The QuickPack List app was designed as a simple, user-friendly tool to help users manage their travel packing lists. The primary purpose of the app is to allow users to input, view, and organize items they plan to pack for a trip. It gives users the ability to enter details such as the item name, category, quantity, and optional comments. The app follows a logical three-screen navigation structure, where users can add items on the first screen, view a summarized list on the second, and finally see a full table format on the third screen.

When launching the app, the user is greeted with a clean and minimal interface. The main screen (MainActivity) contains four input fields—one each for the item name, category, quantity, and a comment section. These input fields use the default Android font for consistency and accessibility. Below the input fields are two clearly labeled buttons: “Add Item” and “View List”. The “Add Item” button is used to collect and validate the information entered by the user. If any required field is empty or the quantity is not a valid number, the app displays helpful Toast messages to inform the user of the mistake and guide them to correct it. Once an item is successfully added, the fields are cleared, and the app displays a success message, making the experience intuitive and interactive.

The “View List” button on the main screen allows users to navigate to the second screen (ListActivity), where they see a simplified summary of their added items in a scrollable list. Each list item displays the item name, quantity, and category, formatted in a concise, readable way. At the bottom of this screen are two buttons: “Back”, which allows the user to return to the previous screen and make further edits or additions, and “View Table”, which takes the user to the final screen.

The third screen (TableActivity) presents a neatly structured table layout, where each item appears in its own row. The columns are clearly labeled with headers: “Name”, “Category”, “Qty”, and “Comments.” This format gives the user a more detailed and professional overview of all their packed items, which can be especially useful for double-checking what’s missing before travel. This screen also includes a “Back” button at the bottom, allowing the user to return to the previous list screen with ease.

In terms of design aesthetics, the app sticks to simple Android components to ensure compatibility and stability across devices. The layout uses LinearLayouts and TableLayouts with appropriate padding and spacing to avoid clutter. In addition, the app can be enhanced visually by setting a background image or applying a specific color scheme (for example, soft blues or travel-inspired earth tones) for better engagement. If implemented, the background image would appear behind the input fields using an ImageView in a FrameLayout, with a soft transparency to keep the content readable.

Fonts used throughout the app are the default Roboto typeface provided by Android, ensuring high legibility and uniformity. However, this can be customized further using XML fontFamily attributes or by importing custom fonts to add personality to the app. Button text is clear, bold, and large enough for users of all ages to interact with comfortably.

Error handling plays a crucial role in the app. Before any item is added, the app checks for empty fields and non-numeric quantities. If an error is found, the user is notified via a Toast message, preventing the app from crashing or saving invalid data. This improves the overall reliability and professionalism of the application.

To summarize, the QuickPack List app is a simple but effective mobile application that allows users to add, review, and organize their packing items in a structured, error-free way. It is visually clean, logically organized across three screens, and ensures user input is validated every step of the way. The inclusion of back buttons and multi-screen navigation reflects a basic yet realistic mobile app development flow suitable for a beginner-to-intermediate developer, aligning perfectly with the IMAD5112 practical assessment requirements.
